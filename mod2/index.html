            "To summarize: it is a well-known fact that those people who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those
            least suited to do it. To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President
            should on no account be allowed to do the job. To summarize the summary of the summary: people are a
            problem."

            "Here and there were a few reptiloid atomineers, two or three green sylphlike maximegalaticins, an octopodic
            physucturalist or two and a Hooloovoo (a Hooloovoo is a superintelligent shade of the color blue). All
            except
            the
            Hooloovoo were resplendant in their multicolored ceremonial lab coats; the Hooloovoo had been temporarily
            refracted
            into a free-standing prism for the occasion."

            "The way it functioned was very interesting. When the Drink button was pressed it made an instant but highly
            detailed examination of the subject's taste buds, a spectroscopic analysis of the subject's metabolism and
            then
            sent
            tiny experimental signals down the neural pathways to the taste centers of the subject's brain to see what
            was
            likely to go down well. However, no one knew quite why it did this because it invariably delivered a cupful
            of
            liquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea.”
